# Real-Time Face Detection and Forehead Pointing

## Description
This repository contains a Python application that utilizes computer vision and deep learning to detect faces in real-time video streams and highlight the forehead area. It is built using OpenCV and Tkinter for GUI interactions.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using a deep learning model.
- Forehead detection for each recognized face.
- Simple and interactive GUI.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Tkinter
- PIL

To get started, clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow
```

## Usage
Run the application with the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

Ensure your webcam is enabled and functioning, as the application captures video feed from the default video source (typically the first webcam device).
